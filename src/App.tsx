/**
 * App root.  BrowserRouter is used here; the dashboard server serves index.html
 * as a SPA fallback for all non-API paths so deep links work on hard reload.
 *
 * Route tree (#1548) — every screen the app can show gets one address:
 *
 *   /                                -> redirect to /pipeline (replace, so
 *                                        it doesn't leave a dead entry back
 *                                        button lands on)
 *   /pipeline                        -> EmptyDetail in the detail slot
 *   /pipeline/:repo/:issue           -> Detail (keyed on repo+issue, not
 *                                        assignment_id -- see Detail.tsx)
 *   /pipeline/:repo/:issue/:tab      -> Detail, tab param threaded through
 *                                        for M-W2 to consume; round-trips
 *                                        today without changing what renders
 *   /sessions                        -> EmptyDetail
 *   /sessions/:id                    -> SessionDetail
 *   /board /machines /merge-queue
 *   /milestones /audit /spend
 *   /settings                        -> ComingSoon(view) -- placeholders for
 *                                        the M-W2+ panels, addressable today
 *                                        so a link to one isn't a 404 while
 *                                        it's being built
 *   /queue                           -> DriveQueuePanel (QW-3) in the list
 *                                        slot, `element={null}` here same as
 *                                        every route above -- there is no
 *                                        detail view for a queue entry yet
 *                                        (QW-4/QW-5)
 *   /reports                         -> ReportsPanel (#21 RPT-2) in the list
 *                                        slot, same `element={null}` posture
 *                                        as /queue -- no detail view for a
 *                                        report result yet
 *   *  (inside the shell)            -> RouteNotFound -- a real not-found
 *                                        state for a genuinely unknown path,
 *                                        rendered inside the shell (rail,
 *                                        status bar) rather than a blank page
 *
 * Every route below `/pipeline` is a child of `ShellLayout`, the react-router
 * *layout route*: the child fills the detail slot (rail + list + detail on
 * wide, the phone app on narrow) and `ShellLayout` derives the rail selection
 * and the list panel's content from the URL itself (`shellViewFromPath`)
 * rather than from separately persisted state -- see `shellState.ts`'s doc
 * comment.
 *
 * The `/` redirect is deliberately declared *outside* `ShellLayout`, as a
 * sibling of it rather than one of its children. `AppShell` only mounts the
 * detail slot -- the thing that would render a child route's `element` --
 * when `showDetail` is true, and on narrow that's `false` until an item is
 * selected (`detailActive`). A redirect placed under `ShellLayout` therefore
 * silently never fires on a phone-sized cold load at `/`: `Outlet` is never
 * mounted, so `<Navigate>`'s effect never runs, and the shell renders with no
 * matched child at all -- exactly the "genuinely unknown route" case, so it
 * falls through to the `*` not-found state instead of redirecting. Matching
 * `/` *before* composing the shell sidesteps the whole class of bug: nothing
 * about "should this redirect fire" may depend on shell layout state.
 *
 * `/terminal/:sessionId` stays deliberately *outside* the shell for a
 * different reason: the PTY pane wants the whole viewport and brings its own
 * key bar, and framing a terminal in a rail plus a status bar would cost it
 * rows on exactly the device (a phone) where rows are scarcest.
