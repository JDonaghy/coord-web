/**
 * Playwright E2E configuration for the coord webapp.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:e2e
 *
 * Prerequisites (one-time per machine):
 *   npx playwright install chromium
 *
 * Design:
 *  - The Vite dev server is started automatically by Playwright's
 *    `webServer` option, so no separate `npm run dev` is needed.
 *  - API calls (`/api/pipeline`, `/api/board`, …) are intercepted via
 *    `page.route()` inside each test — no live Python daemon required.
 *    This keeps the suite deterministic and fast. The one exception is
 *    `live-update-fixture.spec.ts` (#1551), which boots a real
 *    `coord web --fixture` process instead — see that file's header.
 *  - Only Chromium is targeted.  Safari/Firefox variants belong in the
 *    coord/dashboard/webapp smoke_tests capability group; gate them on a
 *    machine with those browsers installed via coordinator.yml.
 *
 * Routing to capable hardware:
 *   coordinator.yml smoke_tests.capability_rules:
 *     - capability: browser
 *       paths: [coord/dashboard/webapp/**]
 *
 * `wide` / `narrow` projects (#1551, M-W1's exit gate): distinct Playwright
 * *projects*, not `test.use({ viewport })` overrides inside `chromium` (which
 * is how `shell.spec.ts` and `smoke.spec.ts` already cover breakpoints) —
 * the story calls for both breakpoints as their own reportable line items.
 * Scoped via `testMatch` to only the files authored for it (`deep-link.
 * spec.ts`, `theme.spec.ts`, and `machine-charts.spec.ts` — #65's issue text
 * is explicit that the Machines panel's charts "must be readable and
 * touchable at ~390px, not merely not-broken") and excluded from `chromium`
 * via `testIgnore` so they don't triple-run; every other spec's breakpoint
 * coverage (if any) stays exactly where it already was, under `chromium`.
 *
 * `machines-responsive.spec.ts` (#67, M-4's exit gate) joins the same list
 * for the same reason: the Machines panel's list/detail split and its theme
 * toggle both need proving at both breakpoints, not just the default
 * viewport `machines.spec.ts` (functional coverage, not breakpoint-specific)
 * runs under.
