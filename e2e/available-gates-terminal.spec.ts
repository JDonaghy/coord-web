/**
 * #2084 — terminal assignments must not inflate the "Needs me" badge.
 *
 * `coord/pipeline.py`'s gate projection used to offer "Dispatch
 * Review"/"Queue for Merge"/"Record Test Verdict" on assignments that had
 * already finished the whole pipeline — chiefly `status == "merged"` rows
 * `coord.reconcile`'s GitHub-truth sweep (`work_is_terminal`) sets
 * independently of the merge queue, which `compute_pipeline` had no branch
 * for and silently treated as indistinguishable from a work item that had
 * never been dispatched anywhere. On the live board this inflated
 * `available_gates` (and therefore the webapp's "Needs me" badge, per
 * `src/lib/pipeline.ts`'s `needsMe = available_gates.length > 0`) to nearly
 * the size of the whole board.
 *
 * This is the black-box regression CLAUDE.md's acceptance bar asks for: a
 * REAL `coord web --fixture` process (not a `page.route()` intercept) runs
 * the actual `compute_pipeline` server-side against a seeded board mixing
 * genuinely-terminal assignments with one genuinely-live one, and the
 * assertions read the rendered "Needs me"/"Active" tab badges — the same
 * counts an operator sees. `tests/test_pipeline.py` covers the unit-level
 * half of the fix; `tests/fixtures/board-pipeline-terminal-gates.json` is
 * this spec's fixture (see that file's header for the three seeded rows).
 *
 * Run: npm run test:e2e (requires `coord` on $PATH, see fixtureServer.ts)
